# Conformal mapping and the geometric theory of holomorphic functions

The narrative roadmap for the conformal-mapping / geometric-function-theory area of complex
analysis, with the **Riemann mapping theorem** as its summit; `Targets.lean` states the
milestones as `sorry`-goals. Among its applications: the modular-`λ` uniformization
`ℍ/Γ(2) ≅ ℂ∖{0,1}` (hence Picard's little theorem and the elliptic/modular uniformization)
and the boundary regularity of conformal maps — but the area is foundational complex analysis
in its own right.

Mathlib has the **Cauchy foundations** of complex analysis — contour integration and the
Cauchy integral formula, power series / analyticity, the **open mapping theorem**
(`Complex.AnalyticOnNhd.is_constant_or_isOpenMap`), the **maximum modulus principle**
(`Analysis/Complex/AbsMax`), the **Schwarz lemma** (`Analysis/Complex/Schwarz`), the
**Riemann removable-singularity** theorem, the rectangle-integral vanishing lemmas, the unit
disc `Complex.UnitDisc`, `conjCLE`/`starRingEnd ℂ` — but **almost none of the geometric /
boundary superstructure built on them**: no argument principle, no Rouché or Hurwitz, no
Morera as a named theorem, no normal families / Montel, **no Riemann mapping theorem**, no
Schwarz reflection, no Carathéodory boundary correspondence, no Schwarz–Christoffel, no
Schwarz–Pick / hyperbolic metric, no analytic continuation / monodromy theorem.

The goal is to **build that geometric theory as a reusable library**, with the **Riemann
mapping theorem** (RMT) as the summit. "Done" means a researcher in conformal geometry,
several-complex-variables, modular forms, or PDE finds the objects — conformal
isomorphisms, normal families, the reflected continuation, the boundary correspondence — at
their natural generality with full basic API, so RMT and its boundary regularity are
*consequences of a developed theory*, not isolated endpoints.

Suggested home: `TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/` (with
`…/Conformal/ArgumentPrinciple.lean`, `…/NormalFamilies.lean`, `…/RiemannMapping.lean`,
`…/Reflection.lean`, `…/BoundaryCorrespondence.lean`).

## Prior art

- **Mathlib:** none of the layer summits below (RMT, reflection, Rouché, Montel, …) are
  present; only the foundations listed above. (`Analysis/Complex/Schwarz.lean` is the
  Schwarz *lemma*, not the reflection *principle*.)
- **Isabelle/HOL:** the **Riemann mapping theorem is formalized** (Paulson, `Riemann_Mapping`
  in `HOL-Complex_Analysis`), so RMT is *achievable* — Lean simply lacks it. The reflection
  principle and Schwarz–Christoffel appear unformalized in Lean and were not found in a
  search of other provers. So this area ports/re-proves RMT into Lean and adds genuinely new
  material on top.

## Generality bar (decide up front; do not silently specialize)

- **Scalar `ℂ`, the geometric (one-complex-variable) theory.** RMT and the boundary theory
  are `ℂ`-specific; state them for `f : ℂ → ℂ`. The layer-0 lemmas that are naturally
  Banach-`E`-valued — Schwarz reflection and the maximum-principle pieces — are **stated at
  that generality**, matching Mathlib's `E`-valued forms; everything from normal families
  (L1) and the Riemann mapping theorem upward is scalar `ℂ`.
- **Domains: open + connected, simple-connectivity via Mathlib.** Use `IsOpen`,
  `IsConnected`/`IsPreconnected`, and `SimplyConnectedSpace ↥Ω` (Mathlib's class) — never an
  ad hoc "no holes". RMT's hypotheses are: `Ω` open, simply connected, `Ω ≠ univ`, nonempty.
- **Conformal isomorphism = holomorphic bijection.** A biholomorphism `Ω ≃ Ω'` is a
  `DifferentiableOn ℂ` bijection with `DifferentiableOn ℂ` inverse; since holomorphic +
  injective ⇒ open with holomorphic inverse (open mapping), state RMT's conclusion as
  `∃ f, DifferentiableOn ℂ f Ω ∧ Set.InjOn f Ω ∧ f '' Ω = Metric.ball 0 1` and derive the
  packaged `≃` / `ConformalAt` API as companions. Relate to Mathlib's `ConformalAt`.
- **Target disc: `Complex.UnitDisc` / `Metric.ball (0:ℂ) 1`.** Reuse the existing disc and
  its automorphism/`Schwarz` API; do not re-encode the disc.
- **Convergence of holomorphic families: `TendstoLocallyUniformlyOn`** (compact-open), the
  topology under which "holomorphic" is closed and Montel lives. Local boundedness =
  "bounded on each compact `K ⊆ Ω`".
- **Reflection: real-axis first; conjugation is `starRingEnd ℂ`; explicit witness.** See L4.

## Layers (each a discharge-gated milestone; `sorry` in `Targets.lean` is the goal)

- **L0 — the local-mapping engine** (consumes the sibling **ContourIntegration** roadmap,
  PR #35). The *argument principle*, residues, winding numbers, and the *global/homological
  Cauchy theorem* are #35's deliverables (`TauCeti/Analysis/Contour/`) — **consume them, do
  not re-derive**. This layer adds the *conformal-geometric* consequences on top: *Rouché*,
  *Hurwitz* (locally-uniform limits of zero-free maps are zero-free or `≡ 0`), the
  open-mapping degree, and *Morera* as a named theorem. The open mapping theorem and `AbsMax`
  are consumed from Mathlib.
- **L1 — normal families / Montel.** Locally bounded ⇒ precompact for
  `TendstoLocallyUniformlyOn` (every sequence has a locally-uniformly-convergent subsequence
  with holomorphic limit); Vitali. The compactness engine RMT runs on.
- **L2 — Schwarz lemma extensions.** *Schwarz–Pick* (holomorphic disc self-maps contract the
  pseudo-hyperbolic metric), the **hyperbolic / Poincaré metric** on `𝔻`, and the disc
  automorphism group `Aut(𝔻) = {e^{iθ}(z−a)/(1−āz)}`. Built on Mathlib's Schwarz lemma.
- **L3 — the Riemann mapping theorem (summit).** Every simply connected proper open
  `Ω ⊊ ℂ` (nonempty) is biholomorphic to `𝔻`. Standard route: the family of injective
  holomorphic `Ω → 𝔻` fixing a point is nonempty (square-root trick on simple-connectivity)
  and normal (L1); maximize `|f′(z₀)|`; the maximizer is onto (else compose with a disc
  automorphism + square root to beat it — L2). Uniqueness up to `Aut(𝔻)`.
- **L4 — analytic continuation & the reflection principle.** Morera-based **Schwarz
  reflection** across `ℝ` (witness `F z = if 0 ≤ z.im then f z else conj (f (conj z))`),
  then across an analytic arc / circle by Möbius reduction; **Painlevé removability** across
  an arc; the **monodromy theorem** (continuations along homotopic paths agree). Reflection's
  reflected branch needs the antiholomorphic-composition lemma (L4.0). *This is the layer the
  SW modular-`λ` covering consumes.*
- **L5 — Carathéodory boundary correspondence.** The RMT map of a Jordan domain extends to a
  homeomorphism of closures; prime ends in general. Uses L4 (reflection) for analytic
  boundary arcs.
- **L6 — Schwarz–Christoffel.** Explicit conformal maps onto polygons, built on L4 + L5
  (sequenced last, after the boundary theory it needs).

## Relation to sibling roadmaps (this entry is the connective layer)

This area sits **between two of Chris Birkbeck's roadmaps** and feeds two more, so it is
deliberately scoped to the conformal-mapping spine that none of them build:

- **Below — `ContourIntegration` (PR #35).** Provides residues, winding numbers, the
  argument principle, and the global Cauchy theorem (Dixon). **L0 consumes it.**
- **Above — `ModularForms` (PR #36).** A 13-layer entry targeting modular curves as moduli
  with `Y(Γ)(ℂ) ≅ Γ\ℍ`. The **modular & elliptic uniformization** — including the
  `ℍ/Γ(2) ≅ ℂ∖{0,1}` `λ`-covering, the
  `j`-invariant, and Picard's theorem — belongs there; it **consumes our L4 (reflection) +
  L5 (boundary correspondence)** together with `UniversalCovers` (deck group). We do **not**
  claim the modular layer here; we supply the conformal inputs it needs.
- **Consumers — `HeegaardFloer` (merged)** uses **L4 Schwarz reflection** for its
  Cauchy–Riemann boundary conditions; **`UniversalCovers` (merged)** supplies the deck-group
  Galois correspondence the `λ`-covering pairs with L4/L5.

So the unique content of this entry — **Montel/normal families, the Riemann mapping theorem,
Schwarz–Pick, reflection, Carathéodory** — is exactly the conformal spine missing between the
residue engine (#35) and the modular/geometric consumers (#36, HeegaardFloer, UniversalCovers).

## Other downstream

Several complex variables, PDE (conformal/quasiconformal mappings), and special-function
theory all consume the conformal-mapping and boundary layers.
