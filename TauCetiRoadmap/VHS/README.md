# Roadmap: variation of Hodge structure (general)

The narrative roadmap for **Hodge theory's linear-algebraic core and the abstract theory of its
variations**, at general weight, as a reusable library; `Targets.lean` states the milestones as
`sorry`-goals. Its summit in the pure theory is the **semisimplicity of polarized Hodge structures**
(Hodge–Riemann), and in the mixed theory Deligne's **strictness**; on top sits the abstract framework
of **variations of Hodge structure** (period domains, period maps, monodromy). Written to the roadmap
conventions: build the library not one theorem, ground in Mathlib's vocabulary, pin conventions up
front, and — because this is a subject Mathlib has *nothing* on — get the **definitions** right (the
`JacobianChallenge` philosophy: the definitions are the deliverable).

**Mathlib has no Hodge structures at all** — no pure or mixed Hodge structures, no polarizations, no
Hodge–Riemann relations, no period domains, no variations, no period maps, no Griffiths transversality.
It has exactly the linear-algebra and geometry *prerequisites*, and this roadmap is built on them
(named in *Prior art*). The goal is that a researcher in Hodge theory, periods, modular forms, motives,
or mathematical physics finds pure and mixed Hodge structures, polarizations, period domains, and
variations (with the period map and monodromy) at their natural generality with full basic API — so
that the structural theorems are *consequences of a developed library*, not isolated endpoints.

Crucially, **this entry is the *structural* theory only.** Everything below is formalizable as linear
algebra + filtrations + local systems, with **no deep analysis or geometry**. The two deep inputs that
*produce* Hodge structures —

- the **Hodge decomposition** of a compact Kähler manifold (`Hⁿ = ⊕ H^{p,q}`, harmonic theory), and
- **Gauss–Manin** for a general smooth projective family (fibers' cohomology ⇒ a variation),

— together with **Schmid's asymptotic theory** (nilpotent/`SL₂`-orbit theorems, limiting MHS) are
**out of scope** here; they are the geometric/analytic engines that supply *instances*. The framework
defines what a Hodge structure and a variation *are* and proves their structural properties; concrete
instances come from elsewhere (the weight-1 / abelian-variety case — curves and their Jacobians — is
the worked model; see *Relation to sibling roadmaps*).

Suggested home: `TauCeti/Geometry/Hodge/` (`…/Hodge/Structure.lean`, `…/Polarization.lean`,
`…/Mixed.lean`, `…/PeriodDomain.lean`, `…/Variation.lean`).

## Prior art

- **Mathlib — the prerequisites this entry consumes (nothing on Hodge theory itself).**
  - Tensor/base change: `TensorProduct ℤ ℂ V` and `TensorProduct ℤ ℚ V` (the complexification /
    rationalification of the lattice), `TensorProduct.map`, `TensorProduct.AlgebraTensorModule.congr`
    and `…cancelBaseChange` (the tower iso `ℂ ⊗_ℚ (ℚ ⊗_ℤ V) ≃ ℂ ⊗_ℤ V`), `LinearMap.baseChange`,
    `Submodule.baseChange`, `Basis.baseChange`.
  - Bilinear forms: `LinearMap.BilinForm`, `BilinForm.baseChange` (extension of scalars of a form,
    with `baseChange_tmul`), `BilinForm.Nondegenerate`, `.IsOrtho`, `.IsSymm`/`.IsAlt`, `.restrict`.
  - Filtrations/decompositions: `Submodule`, `IsCompl`, `DirectSum.IsInternal`, `Module.finrank`,
    `Module.Free`/`Module.Finite` (the lattice), `Antitone`/`Monotone`.
  - Conjugation: `starRingEnd ℂ` (complex conjugation as the semilinearity ring hom); there is **no**
    packaged real/integral complexification-with-conjugation, so `latticeConj` is built here.
  - For variations (L4, downstream): `CategoryTheory.FundamentalGroupoid`, `Module ℤ` (local systems),
    and Mathlib's complex-manifold / connection API (Griffiths transversality).
  - Rigidity engine (L5): `Module.End`, `Module.End.HasEigenvalue` / `Module.End.exists_eigenvalue`
    over the algebraically closed `ℂ`.
- **Other proof assistants.** Hodge structures, polarizations, and variations of Hodge structure
  appear **essentially unformalized anywhere** (Isabelle/HOL, Coq/Rocq, Lean). Adjacent pieces exist
  (abelian varieties and the upper half-space in various places), but the abstract Hodge-theoretic
  superstructure is new foundational material, not a port.
- **The weight-1 instance is concrete and reachable.** Polarized weight-1 Hodge structures are
  abelian varieties / complex tori `ℂ^g/Λ`; their period domain is the **Siegel upper half space**;
  their integral symmetry group is `Sp(2g, ℤ)`. That case (periods of curves, Jacobians) is a worked
  realization of the framework's weight-1 interface and is being developed concretely — evidence the
  abstract definitions are instantiable.

## Core definitions (the chief deliverable)

Getting these right is the point of the entry; each is stated in `Targets.lean` and elaborates against
the pinned Mathlib.

- **The integral lattice is primary datum.** A weight-`n` Hodge structure is carried on a finitely
  generated free `ℤ`-module `V = V_ℤ` (`[Module.Free ℤ V] [Module.Finite ℤ V]`). The complex space is
  the complexification `V_ℂ := ℂ ⊗[ℤ] V` (`Complexification V`), the rational space
  `V_ℚ := ℚ ⊗[ℤ] V` (`Rationalification V`). A Hodge structure is **not** modeled as a bare complex
  vector space with a free-floating involution — that loses the arithmetic and makes semisimplicity /
  monodromy unstatable at their real strength.
- **Conjugation is defined, not assumed.** `latticeConj : V_ℂ →ₛₗ[starRingEnd ℂ] V_ℂ`,
  `z ⊗ v ↦ z̄ ⊗ v`, is constructed as `TensorProduct.map (starRingEnd ℂ) id` and bundled as a
  conjugate-linear map, with `map_smul` and `latticeConj_involutive` **proved**. The `n`-opposedness
  `IsCompl (F^p) (conj F^{n+1-p})` and the `(p,q)`-piece `F^p ⊓ conj(F^{n-p})` use this canonical map.
- **Polarization is one integral form.** `Polarization` stores a single
  `Qint : LinearMap.BilinForm ℤ V`; its complex form is **derived**, `Q := Qint.baseChange ℂ`, so the
  integral↔complex link is Mathlib's `baseChange_tmul`, not a hand-imposed axiom. `(-1)^n`-symmetry
  lives on `Qint`; `nondegenerate` is `BilinForm.Nondegenerate`; `orthogonal` is `BilinForm.IsOrtho`;
  the Hodge–Riemann positivity `i^{p−q} Q(v, v̄) > 0` on `H^{p,q}` is a real-and-positive condition.
- **Rational substructures derive their complexification.** A `RationalHodgeSubstructure` carries only
  its `ℚ`-subspace `WQ`; the complex side `WC := rationalToComplexSubmodule WQ` is
  `Submodule.baseChange ℂ` composed with the tower iso `cancelBaseChange` — so there is no bare-`Prop`
  "is the complexification" placeholder. Likewise the mixed weight filtration.
  *Implementation note:* nested base changes (`ℂ ⊗_ℚ (ℚ ⊗_ℤ V)`) are ergonomically heavy in Lean; the
  implementation should carry a `@[simp]` suite for moving elements through `rationalToComplexSubmodule`
  and `Polarization.Q` (the `Q_tmul` pure-tensor lemma is the first of these) to keep the L1/L2 proofs
  tractable.

## Generality bar (decide up front; do not silently specialize)

- **Weight-general, polarized, integral.** State pure Hodge structures for arbitrary weight `n : ℤ` on
  the integral lattice; `ℚ`/`ℝ` variants are base changes. Do **not** hardcode weight 1 — weight 1 is
  the *example*, not the definition. Semisimplicity is stated over `ℚ`; monodromy lands in `Aut(V_ℤ, Q)`
  (integral automorphisms preserving the form).
- **Period domains à la Griffiths.** The classifying space `D` of polarized Hodge structures of a fixed
  Hodge type is a homogeneous space `G_ℝ/V`, open in a flag variety; weight 1 recovers Siegel
  (`Sp(2g,ℝ)/U(g)`). Build `D` at general type; do not collapse to Siegel.
- **Variations are abstract.** A VHS is a local system + a holomorphic Hodge-filtration bundle +
  **Griffiths transversality** (`∇F^p ⊆ F^{p−1}⊗Ω¹`), over a complex-manifold base — *defined*, not
  produced from geometry.
- **Stop at the structural theory.** Hodge decomposition for Kähler manifolds, Gauss–Manin of general
  families, and Schmid's asymptotics are **explicitly downstream** — name them, don't bake them in.

## Conventions (pinned)

- **Hodge filtration as the primary analytic datum.** A weight-`n` HS on `V` is a decreasing filtration
  `F^•` on `V_ℂ` that is **`n`-opposed**: `F^p ⊕ \overline{F^{n+1−p}} = V_ℂ` for all `p` (equivalently
  the `(p,q)`-decomposition with `V^{q,p} = \overline{V^{p,q}}`). Bounded: `F^p = ⊤` for `p ≪ 0`, `⊥`
  for `p ≫ 0` (needed to rule out degenerate filtrations with vanishing pieces).
- **Polarization:** a `(−1)^n`-symmetric integral form `Q` with the **Hodge–Riemann relations**
  (`Q(F^p, F^{n−p+1}) = 0`; `i^{p−q} Q(v, v̄) > 0` on `V^{p,q}`).
- **Mixed:** an increasing weight filtration `W_•` (over `ℚ`) + decreasing `F^•` inducing a pure
  weight-`k` HS on each `gr^W_k`.
- **Symmetry group / monodromy:** `G = Aut(V, Q)`; monodromy of a VHS is `ρ : π₁(B) → G(ℤ)`.

## Layers (each a discharge-gated milestone; the `sorry` goal in `Targets.lean` is the target)

- **L0 — Pure Hodge structures; the Hodge decomposition.**
  *Definitions:* `HodgeStructure V n` (the `n`-opposed bounded filtration), `piece p = F^p ⊓ conj(F^{n−p})`.
  *Milestone:* `DirectSum.IsInternal hs.piece` — the `(p,q)`-pieces are an internal direct sum
  `V_ℂ = ⨁_p H^{p,q}`.
  *Discharge:* the standard equivalence "`n`-opposed filtration ⟺ `(p,q)`-decomposition." From
  `opposed` (`IsCompl (F^p) (conj F^{n+1−p})`) plus boundedness, prove by descending induction on `p`
  that `F^p = ⨆_{p'≥p} H^{p',·}` and that the pieces are independent (`H^{p,q} ⊓ ⨆_{p'>p} H^{p',·} = ⊥`
  from opposedness); assemble via `DirectSum.isInternal_submodule_iff_iSupIndep_and_iSup_eq_top`,
  `iSupIndep`, `IsCompl`. Voisin I, §6 (the opposedness lemma). *Companions to build:* morphisms of HS,
  the `(p,q)` symmetry `conj (piece p) = piece (n−p)`, `ℤ`-Tate twist, `⊗`/`Hom`/dual.
- **L1 — Polarization & Hodge–Riemann; semisimplicity (summit of the pure theory).**
  *Definitions:* `Polarization hs` (integral `Qint`, derived `Q`, HR relations),
  `RationalHodgeSubstructure`.
  *Milestone:* every rational Hodge substructure `W` has an orthogonal rational Hodge-substructure
  complement (`IsCompl` on both `WQ` and `WC`, `Q`-orthogonal) — hence **the category of polarized
  `ℚ`-HS is semisimple.**
  *Discharge:* the Hodge–Riemann positivity makes `h(u,v) := i^{p−q} Q(u, v̄)` a positive-definite
  Hermitian form on each piece, so `V_ℂ` carries a definite Hermitian form for which `conj`/`Q` are
  compatible; the `Q`-orthogonal complement of a sub-HS is again a sub-HS, and (since `Q` is rational
  and nondegenerate) it is defined over `ℚ`. `V = W ⊕ W^⊥`. Consume the `BilinForm.Nondegenerate`
  orthogonal-complement API and the L0 decomposition. Voisin I, §7.1.2; Peters–Steenbrink §2.
- **L2 — Mixed Hodge structures; strictness (Deligne).**
  *Definitions:* `MixedHodgeStructure V` — the `ℚ`-weight filtration `WQ` (monotone and **bounded**,
  `WQ_top`/`WQ_bot`, mirroring `HodgeStructure`), the Hodge filtration `F`, and `graded_pure`; morphisms
  compatible with `W`, `F`, `conj`. The complexified weight `WC_k := rationalToComplexSubmodule (WQ_k)`
  is *derived*, and its monotonicity and conjugation-stability are **proved lemmas**
  (`rationalToComplexSubmodule_mono`, `…_conj`), not structure fields — so instances are
  correct-by-construction, not burdened with re-proving them. `graded_pure` is the **genuine
  induced-purity axiom** (not a placeholder): the graded piece `grᵂ_k = W_k/W_{k-1}` is built as a
  quotient module (`Submodule.submoduleOf`), `latticeConj` descends to it (semilinear `Submodule.mapQ` —
  `gradedConj`), `F` induces a filtration on it (`mkQ` image — `gradedF`), and `graded_pure` requires
  *that* induced filtration to be bounded and `k`-opposed with respect to `gradedConj` — structurally
  identical to `HodgeStructure.opposed`. So an MHS really is one.
  *Milestone:* a morphism of MHS is **strict** for **both** filtrations:
  `range f ⊓ W'_k = f(W_k)` and `range f ⊓ F'^p = f(F^p)`. Because `graded_pure` now carries real
  purity, the milestone's hypotheses are true (the earlier weight-only, weak-hypothesis version was a
  false statement).
  *Discharge:* Deligne's canonical `(p,q)`-bigrading of an MHS (the Deligne splitting) — every MHS
  morphism respects the bigrading, whence strictness for both filtrations. Requires the two-filtration
  / bigrading lemma. For the roadmap it suffices to establish the splitting *propositionally* (existence
  of the `I^{p,q}` bigrading), not as a computational normal form. A `@[simp]` suite for pushing
  elements through `gradedConj`/`gradedF` (as with `Polarization.Q_tmul`) will be wanted to keep the
  quotient manipulations tractable. Deligne, *Théorie de Hodge II*, 1.2.10 & 2.3.5; Peters–Steenbrink
  Ch. 3.
  *Morphisms:* the milestone frames a morphism *unbundled* (the pair `fQ`/`fC` + compatibility
  hypotheses) so the target is bundling-agnostic. The implementation should then bundle these into an
  `MHS.Hom` / category to carry the **abelian-category** structure — strictness is exactly what makes
  kernels and cokernels of MHS morphisms again MHS (with the induced filtrations).
- **L3 — Period domains.**
  *Definitions:* `HodgeType` (fixed Hodge numbers `h : ℤ → ℕ`, finite support), `PeriodDomain V n htype`
  (a polarized HS of that type).
  *Milestone (seeded):* the Hodge numbers partition the dimension, `∑ᶠ p, h p = dim_ℂ V_ℂ` — the
  numerical shadow of L0, a genuine constraint on `HodgeType`.
  *Discharge:* from L0 (`DirectSum.IsInternal`) plus `hodge_numbers` (`finrank (piece p) = h p`), the
  total dimension is the finsum of piece dimensions — additivity of `Module.finrank` over the internal
  direct sum (via `DirectSum.IsInternal` + `Module.finrank`/`Basis`); `Basis.baseChange` gives
  `dim_ℂ V_ℂ = rank_ℤ V`.
  *Deeper target (out of scope here):* the complex structure on `D` as an **open** subset of the flag
  variety of filtrations with the given ranks, the `G_ℝ`-action, and the weight-1 ⇒ Siegel
  identification — these need flag-variety topology and are described but not seeded.
- **L4 — Variations of Hodge structure.**
  *Definitions:* `PolarizedMonodromyRepresentation` (the honest monodromy facet: `ρ : Γ →* (V ≃ₗ[ℤ] V)`
  preserving `Qint`, with the derived `complexMonodromy : Γ →* (V_ℂ ≃ₗ[ℂ] V_ℂ)`), and a schematic
  `VariationOfHodgeStructure B V n Γ` (fiber HS + polarization + monodromy + a `hodgeBundle` +
  `holomorphic`/`griffiths_transversality` placeholders).
  *Milestone:* **none self-contained.** The genuine L4 target — the period map `B̃ → D` (holomorphic,
  **horizontal**, i.e. Griffiths transversality `∇F^p ⊆ F^{p−1}⊗Ω¹`) — is analytic and needs the
  connection / complex-geometry infrastructure the README declares downstream. The provable engine that
  L4 contributes to the rigidity theory is the **L5 Schur** lemma below.
  *Mathlib interface (when built):* model the **local system** as a functor
  `CategoryTheory.FundamentalGroupoid B ⥤ Module ℤ` (equivalently, on a connected base, a
  `π₁(B, b₀)`-representation on the fiber — Mathlib's `FundamentalGroup` / `MonoidHom`); the filtration
  bundle and Griffiths transversality build on Mathlib's complex-manifold + connection API. The bare
  `holomorphic`/`griffiths_transversality` fields are placeholders for exactly these.
  *Implementation staging:* `PolarizedMonodromyRepresentation` is the concrete **pre-variation**
  deliverable (local system + monodromy + integral form) and lands first, independently of any analytic
  input. The full `VariationOfHodgeStructure` (holomorphic `hodgeBundle` + Griffiths transversality) is
  deferred until Mathlib's complex-manifold/connection API can *replace* the placeholder `Prop` fields —
  those placeholders are roadmap-spec markers and are **not** carried into merged implementation code.
- **L5 — Rigidity & semisimplicity.** Two tiers, kept distinct:
  *(i) the linear-algebraic engine (the milestone):* **finite-dimensional Schur** — if
  `complexMonodromy` is irreducible then its commutant is scalar (`∃ c, ∀ v, T v = c • v`).
  *Discharge:* over the algebraically closed `ℂ`, a commuting endomorphism `T` of a finite-dimensional
  irreducible representation has an eigenvalue (`Module.End.exists_eigenvalue`); `ker (T − c)` is a
  nonzero invariant subspace, hence everything, so `T = c`. Consume `Module.End.HasEigenvalue`,
  invariant-subspace API.
  *(ii) the genuine theorems that invoke it (deeper targets, not the Schur lemma):* period-map
  **rigidity** and Deligne's **theorem of the fixed part** / semisimplicity of monodromy — these need
  actual *polarizable VHS* hypotheses (a real variation, not merely a form-preserving representation)
  and are stated as downstream targets, not milestones here.

## Relation to sibling roadmaps

- **`JacobianChallenge` (AG Jacobian).** Complementary, not overlapping: that entry builds
  `Jac = Pic⁰` as a *scheme* via the Abel–Jacobi universal property; this entry is the *transcendental*
  Hodge theory. They meet at one bridge — over `ℂ`, `Jac(X)(ℂ) ≅ ℂ^g/period-lattice` (the weight-1
  instance) — a natural joint target, not a duplication.
- **`ModularForms` (PR #47).** Modular forms are sections over modular curves carrying the universal
  weight-1 VHS; this framework supplies the VHS/period-map side.
- **`ContourIntegration` (PR #35).** Periods of the concrete instances are contour integrals —
  consumed when realizing examples (the weight-1 period matrices).

## Downstream

Periods and period maps; the Hodge conjecture's setting; mixed Hodge modules and motives; mirror
symmetry; modular/Shimura varieties; and the concrete **weight-1 / curve** realization (Jacobians,
period matrices, Riemann bilinear relations) — the worked instance of L0–L4 at `n = 1`, and the point
of contact with the Seiberg–Witten period story.

*NOTE: `Targets.lean` proposes the core definitions (the chief deliverable of this entry) with a
genuine milestone `sorry` at **L0, L1, L2, L3, L5**. The Hodge structure carries its integral lattice
`V_ℤ` as primary datum, with `V_ℂ = ℂ ⊗ V_ℤ` and a *defined* canonical conjugation `latticeConj`, and
is grounded in Mathlib's base-change vocabulary throughout (`BilinForm.baseChange`, `Submodule.baseChange`,
`cancelBaseChange`). **L4** contributes the honest monodromy facet plus a schematic
`VariationOfHodgeStructure` seed — it has **no self-contained provable milestone**, because period-map
horizontality / Griffiths transversality is analytic and out of scope; its provable engine is the L5
Schur lemma. The only remaining schematic placeholders are the **L4 analytic fields** (`holomorphic`,
`griffiths_transversality`) — the genuinely out-of-scope complex-geometry inputs; the MHS `graded_pure`
axiom is now fully encoded (real induced purity on `gr^W_k`). Elaborated green against `TauCetiRoadmap`'s
pinned Mathlib (leanprover/lean4:v4.31.0-rc1); the milestone `example`s carry `sorry`, every definition
is complete.*
