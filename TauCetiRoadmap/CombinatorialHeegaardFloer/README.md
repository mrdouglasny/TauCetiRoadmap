# Roadmap: Combinatorial Heegaard Floer and grid homology

Heegaard Floer homology (Ozsváth–Szabó) and its knot-theoretic sibling knot Floer
homology are among the most consequential inventions of twenty-first-century
low-dimensional topology: they categorify the Alexander polynomial, detect Seifert
genus and fiberedness, bound the slice genus and unknotting number (reproving the
Milnor conjecture), and power most modern progress on surgery, concordance, and
contact geometry. Nothing remotely near them exists in any proof assistant; Mathlib
has no knots, no 3-manifolds, and no symplectic geometry. This roadmap is the
**combinatorial half**: the bodies of theory that are formalizable now, with real
topological payoffs of their own — grid homology, lattice homology, and the
Ozsváth–Stipsicz–Szabó stable HF̂ — carried all the way down (definition, invariance
proof, and applications). The analytic tower (Fredholm theory, transversality,
Gromov compactness, gluing, Lagrangian Floer homology, holomorphic HF̂) is its
companion [Heegaard Floer roadmap](../HeegaardFloer/README.md); the two meet at
reconciliation theorems that the analytic roadmap states, since they wait on
its slower track.

This is **not a linear roadmap**. It is a family of lanes with many independent
on-ramps; nearly every lane is publishable mathematics on its own, and several would
be a first in any prover. Suggested homes: `TauCeti/KnotTheory/Grid/`,
`TauCeti/KnotTheory/Diagrams/`, `TauCeti/Algebra/Bigraded/`,
`TauCeti/LowDimTopology/` (lattice homology, Heegaard diagrams).

## The organizing dichotomy

**Combinatorial computability is not combinatorial definition-with-invariance.**
Most "combinatorial" results in this field (Sarkar–Wang nice diagrams
([arXiv:math/0607777](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0607777)), the grid-diagram
computability of all flavors (Manolescu–Ozsváth–Thurston
[arXiv:0910.0078](https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.0078), resting on the ~280-page
Manolescu–Ozsváth link surgery formula
[arXiv:1011.1317](https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1317)), bordered-Floer factoring of
mapping classes ([arXiv:1010.2550](https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2550))) are
*algorithms whose correctness certificates are holomorphic*. Exactly two bodies of
theory are combinatorial all the way down (definition, invariance proof, and
applications), plus one combinatorial neighbor:

1. **Grid homology for knots and links** (Manolescu–Ozsváth–Szabó–Thurston
   [arXiv:math/0610559](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0610559); the book
   Ozsváth–Stipsicz–Szabó, *Grid Homology for Knots and Links*, AMS 2015). The
   book's main line (Chapters 1–15) is deliberately self-contained: invariance
   reduces to Cromwell's theorem (proved in its Appendix B), spectral sequences are
   explicitly avoided, and the holomorphic identification (Chapter 16) is needed for
   **nothing**: not invariance, not τ, not the combinatorial Milnor-conjecture
   proof, not the slice-genus bound, not the Legendrian/transverse invariants, not
   ℤ coefficients. What is lost without holomorphic input is only sharpness and
   detection (genus *detection*, fiberedness, unknot detection).
2. **Stable combinatorial HF̂ of 3-manifolds** (Ozsváth–Stipsicz–Szabó
   [arXiv:0912.0830](https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0830), ℤ-signs sequel
   [arXiv:1301.0480](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0480)): the *unique* published
   fully-combinatorial definition-plus-invariance of a Heegaard Floer 3-manifold
   invariant: HF̂ up to tracked `(𝔽 ⊕ 𝔽)`-tensor factors, exactly HF̂ for
   `b₁(Y) = 0` via a twisted refinement.
3. **Lattice homology** of plumbed 3-manifolds (Némethi
   [arXiv:0709.0841](https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0841), after Ozsváth–Szabó
   [arXiv:math/0203265](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0203265)): pure lattice
   combinatorics, invariance under Neumann moves, and Zemke's theorem
   ([arXiv:2111.14962](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14962)) that it computes `HF⁻` of
   all plumbed manifolds.

These three are exactly what this roadmap formalizes. The holomorphic theory is
**on the roadmap, not a non-goal** — it is just the [other half](../HeegaardFloer/README.md),
and the seams where the two halves meet are the reconciliation theorems, which that
roadmap owns (they are analytic-blocked, so they live with the slower track).

## The end goals

- **v1 (knots, combinatorial).** Grid homology `GH̃`, `GĤ`, `GH⁻` over 𝔽₂ with full
  invariance, the concordance invariant τ, and the **Milnor conjecture**
  `u(T_{p,q}) = (p−1)(q−1)/2`, a genuinely celebrated theorem (first proved by
  Kronheimer–Mrowka with gauge theory), by pure combinatorics.
- **v2 (3-manifolds, combinatorial).** Ozsváth–Stipsicz–Szabó's stable `HF̂_st(Y)`
  over 𝔽₂, with its purely topological invariance proof.
- **Reconciliations (owned by the analytic roadmap).** Each invariant here has a
  "the two definitions agree" theorem matching it to its holomorphic counterpart
  (grid homology = knot Floer homology; `HF̂_st` = stabilized holomorphic `HF̂`;
  lattice homology = `HF⁻` of plumbed manifolds). These seams wait on the
  analytic tower, which is the long pole, so they are stated and tracked in the
  [analytic roadmap](../HeegaardFloer/README.md), not here.

```lean
-- the shapes we are building toward (state in Targets.lean as the types land):
--
-- v1: grid homology is a link invariant, and τ bounds unknotting number:
-- def GH' (G : GridDiagram) : BigradedModule (ZMod 2) := ...   -- simply blocked GĤ
-- theorem GH'_invariant (G G' : GridDiagram) (h : G.MovesTo G') : GH' G ≅ GH' G'
-- theorem tau_le_unknotting (K : GridKnot) : |τ K| ≤ unknottingNumber K
-- theorem milnor_conjecture (p q : ℕ) (h : Nat.Coprime p q) :
--     unknottingNumber (torusKnot p q) = (p - 1) * (q - 1) / 2
```

## Standing conventions (spell them out; never bake in)

- **𝔽₂ first, ℤ as a separate later stage.** Signs are a genuinely separable layer
  everywhere in this subject: grid homology has sign assignments
  (MOST; Gallais [arXiv:0706.0089](https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0089)). State every 𝔽₂
  theorem so the coefficient ring can be generalized without restating the topology.
- **A link *is* (at first) a grid diagram modulo grid moves.** Knot theory needs no
  privileged representation: the grid theory is self-contained with this
  definition, and the identification with embeddings `S¹ ↪ S³` (via Cromwell's
  theorem and Reidemeister calculus) is its own lane (K), not a prerequisite.
  Reconciliation theorems connect representations later; nothing in Lane G waits
  for topology.
- **State invariance naturality-ready.** In a proof assistant you must decide on
  day one whether "the invariant" is an isomorphism class, a group, or a transitive
  system of groups and isomorphisms (Juhász–Thurston–Zemke
  [arXiv:1210.4996](https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4996)). Phrase invariance as
  specified isomorphisms attached to elementary moves, with composition laws stated
  as separate (later) targets, even while the first theorems prove only the
  isomorphism class. ⚠ Basepoint-moving maps act nontrivially (Zemke); do not
  quotient them away silently.
- **Track stabilization factors explicitly.** The fully blocked grid homology
  `GH̃(G)` depends on grid size: `GH̃(G) ≅ GĤ(L) ⊗ W^{⊗(n−1)}` with
  `W = 𝔽 ⊕ 𝔽` in bigradings (0,0), (−1,−1); OSS's 3-manifold invariant is *stable*
  in the same sense. Build the "graded vector space up to `⊗W`-stabilization"
  quotient as API, not ad hoc.
- **Mind the bigrading bookkeeping.** Maslov gradings via the `J`-function
  (`M_O(x) = J(x−O, x−O) + 1`), Alexander via
  `A = ½(M_O − M_X) − (n−1)/2`: integer-valuedness is a lemma, not a definition.
  Fix once whether differentials drop Maslov by 1 and preserve Alexander
  (unblocked) and write the `(M, A)`-conventions table before stating anything.
- **Keep "computes" as a requirement, not an afterthought.** The acceptance
  criteria below evaluate the invariants on explicit small grids (`n ≤ 5` has at
  most `120` generators). Definitions whose differentials cannot be evaluated by
  `decide`/`Decidable` instances (or fast enough kernel reduction) on those
  examples should be revised. (Lesson from Coq/Agda homology efforts: making
  formal homology compute is the recurring pain point.)

## Inventory: what Mathlib master gives us (consume)

- **Homological algebra, the strong point:** `Mathlib/Algebra/Homology/*`,
  complexes over any `ComplexShape ι` (so ℤ×ℤ-bigraded complexes are immediate),
  homology via `ShortComplex`, homotopies and `HomotopyEquiv.toHomologyIso`
  (`Homotopy.lean`), **mapping cones** (`HomotopyCofiber.lean`,
  `HomotopyCategory/MappingCone.lean`), snake lemma and the long exact sequence
  (`ShortComplex/ShortExact.lean`, `HomologySequence.lean`), bicomplexes/total
  complexes, Euler characteristics (`EulerCharacteristic.lean`). All of it applies
  over `ModuleCat (MvPolynomial (Fin n) (ZMod 2))` directly.
- **Grid combinatorics:** `Mathlib/GroupTheory/Perm/*` (including `Sign`),
  permutation matrices, `Finset`/`Fintype`, `ZMod n` for toroidal indexing.
- **Graded objects:** `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/GradedObject.lean` (+ monoidal
  structure), `DirectSum`, `MvPolynomial`.
- **Presented monoids** (`Mathlib/Algebra/PresentedMonoid/Basic.lean`, from Hannah
  Fechtner's braid program): the seed for Lane K's braid groups.

## Inventory: what is missing (build here)

Everything knot-theoretic (the only knot-adjacent file in Mathlib is
`Algebra/Quandle.lean`); grid diagrams and grid moves; bigraded modules over
`𝔽₂[V₁,…,Vₙ]` as a working API; the structure theorem for finitely generated
bigraded `𝔽[U]`-modules (τ's home); filtered complexes and filtered homotopy type
(Mathlib's spectral-sequence machinery is young and has no filtered-complex
constructor, and the grid main line deliberately avoids spectral sequences, so
only the filtered-complex API is needed); pointed Heegaard diagram combinatorics
and the nice-move calculus; plumbing lattices and weight functions.

---

## The lanes

### Lane G: grid homology (the spine)

Follow Ozsváth–Stipsicz–Szabó's book, whose chapters are nearly a blueprint
already. Milestone order:

1. **Grid diagrams and grid states.** Toroidal `n × n` grids with `O`/`X`-markings
   (one per row and column); grid states as bijections columns → rows; rectangles,
   and **empty** rectangles `Rect°(x, y)`. ⚠ Encoding choice (plain
   `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` vs functions on `ZMod n` vs a `2n × 2n` double cover; cf.
   Kyle Miller's "pointed cyclic orders" suggestion) deserves a short experiment
   before committing; the 2025 summer project (acknowledgements) tried all three.
2. **Gradings.** The `J`-function, `M_O`, `M_X`, `A`; integer-valuedness of `A`;
   grading-change formulas across a rectangle.
3. **The complexes and `∂² = 0`.** Fully blocked `GC̃` over 𝔽₂ (rectangles avoiding
   all markings): `∂² = 0` by the juxtaposition case analysis (disjoint /
   overlapping / annular pairs of empty rectangles), finite combinatorics, the
   ideal first nontrivial theorem. Then unblocked `GC⁻` over `𝔽₂[V₁,…,Vₙ]` and
   simply blocked `GĤ`.
4. **Euler characteristic = Alexander polynomial**, via the grid determinant
   formula (book, Chapter 3.3): an early, decidable, self-validating milestone.
5. **Invariance over 𝔽₂.** Grid moves = commutation + (de)stabilization.
   Commutation: pentagon-counting chain maps with hexagon-counting homotopies.
   Stabilization: identify `GC⁻(G')` with the mapping cone of
   `V₁ − V₂ : GC⁻(G)[V₁] → GC⁻(G)[V₁]` (consume Mathlib's cones). ⚠ The homologies
   of the *blocked* theories depend on grid size through `⊗W` factors; only the
   stabilization-quotient (or `GĤ`, `GH⁻`) is the link invariant.
6. **All `V_i` act identically on homology**; `GH⁻` as `𝔽[U]`-module; the structure
   theorem for finitely generated bigraded `𝔽[U]`-modules; **τ**.
7. **`|τ(K)| ≤ u(K)`** via crossing-change maps; `τ(T_{p,q})` via the canonical
   cycle; **the Milnor conjecture** (book Chapter 6, after Sarkar
   [arXiv:1011.5265](https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5265)).
8. **Symmetries and the genus bound** `g(K) ≥ max{s : GĤ(K, s) ≠ 0}`. ⚠ The book is
   explicit that the combinatorial treatment "falls short of showing these bounds
   are sharp"; sharpness is holomorphic (the analytic roadmap's far future); state
   the bound, not detection.
9. **Skein exact sequence; alternating knots are thin; links** (multivariable
   Alexander polynomial as Euler characteristic; grid polytope vs Thurston norm,
   again bound only).
10. **Slice genus:** `|τ(K)| ≤ g_s(K)` via saddle/birth/death maps and normal forms
    of knot cobordisms (book Appendix B.5): the most topologically substantial
    step of the combinatorial line; gives the combinatorial Kronheimer–Mrowka
    theorem.
11. **Legendrian and transverse GRID invariants** `λ^±`; reprove Chekanov's
    Legendrian non-simplicity of `m(5₂)` combinatorially.
12. **ℤ coefficients** via sign assignments (existence and uniqueness up to gauge;
    MOST §15.2, or Gallais's spin-extension construction).
13. **The filtered theory** (book Chapters 13–14): the Alexander filtration on the
    grid complex over `𝔽[V]`; invariant = filtered quasi-isomorphism type: the
    combinatorial stand-in for `CFK^∞`, and the door to Υ-type concordance
    invariants. Needs Lane ALG's filtered-complex API.

### Lane ALG: bigraded and filtered homological algebra

Mostly assembling Mathlib pieces into a working API, plus genuinely new material:
bigraded modules over `𝔽₂[V₁,…,Vₙ]` with grading-shift conventions; mapping-cone
API at the bigraded level; the **structure theorem for finitely generated bigraded
`𝔽[U]`-modules** (the algebraic home of τ and of "tower plus torsion"
decompositions); **filtered chain complexes** and filtered chain homotopy
equivalence, new to Mathlib, needed only from G.13 onward, and reusable far beyond
this roadmap. ⚠ No spectral sequences are needed anywhere on the main line; resist
building them here.

### Lane K: knot-theory reconciliation

The "no privileged representation" lane, which **consumes** the knot theory built in
the [geometric-topology roadmap](../GeometricTopology/README.md) (layer 4: the
presentations of a knot or link as first-class types, the maps between them, slice-ness,
and the knot polynomials) and connects grid diagrams to it. Grid diagrams are one more
presentation; this lane adds the grid-specific **adequacy theorem**, Cromwell's theorem
(grid moves generate grid equivalence of links; book Appendix B.4, elementary but fiddly
diagrammatic combinatorics), reconciling them with that roadmap's diagrams, braid closures,
and embeddings `S¹ ↪ S³`, and checks G.4's grid determinant against that roadmap's
Alexander polynomial. ⚠ Prior art (Isabelle/AFP knot theory; the Lean `leanknot`
experiment) shows diagram-calculus *adequacy* is where such projects stall, which is
exactly why Lane G does not wait for this lane. ⚠ Coordinate the braid-group and
diagram-calculus foundations with the geometric-topology roadmap (and Hannah Fechtner's
braid-group program) rather than duplicating them here.

### Lane L: lattice homology

Plumbing trees/graphs and their lattices; Némethi's lattice (co)homology
`ℍ⁻`/`ℍ⁰` as a `ℤ[U]`-module from lattice points and weight functions; invariance
under **Neumann moves**; computations for Seifert-fibered examples; `d`-invariant
analogues. Entirely finite combinatorics plus bilinear forms; a self-contained
on-ramp to the *3-manifold* side with no Heegaard diagrams at all, and the cheapest
lane to start in parallel. Far-future reconciliation: Zemke's `ℍ⁻ ≅ HF⁻` (the
analytic roadmap names the `HF⁻` side).

### Lane H: combinatorial HF̂ of 3-manifolds

The Ozsváth–Stipsicz–Szabó stable invariant
([arXiv:0912.0830](https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0830)):

1. Pointed multi-pointed Heegaard diagram *combinatorics* (the diagram as data:
   surface genus, attaching-curve combinatorics, basepoints, no smooth topology
   yet); generators, domains, periodic domains, weak/strong **admissibility**.
2. The nice-move calculus and "convenient" diagrams from pair-of-pants
   decompositions; the chain complex (every count is a bigon or square).
3. `HF̂_st(Y)` over 𝔽₂: well-definedness and the purely topological invariance
   proof; lens spaces and `S¹ × S²` as the first computations.
4. ℤ coefficients via sign assignments
   ([arXiv:1301.0480](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0480)); the twisted refinement
   recovering `HF̂(Y)` on the nose for `b₁(Y) = 0`.

⚠ The serious topological input is **Reidemeister–Singer with basepoints** (any two
pointed Heegaard diagrams of `Y` are connected by moves): Morse/Cerf theory that
does not exist in Mathlib. Treat it the way Lane G treats Cromwell: make "diagrams
modulo moves" the *definition* of the input equivalence class, state the invariance
theorem against it, and put the identification with smooth 3-manifolds in a
separable reconciliation target (which the analytic roadmap's Morse theory will
eventually feed). ⚠ This package has no absolute gradings and no `U`-flavors; do not
promise them here.

The diagram combinatorics of H.1 are also the input the analytic roadmap's Lane F4
consumes when it builds holomorphic `HF̂` over the same diagrams.

## Acceptance criteria ("checks along the way")

Concrete checks that rule out vacuous or mis-stated definitions:

- **Grid homology computes:** `GĤ` of the unknot (2×2 grid) and the trefoil
  (5×5), with their bigradings, by `decide`-style evaluation; `GH̃` of an `n × n`
  unknot grid exhibits the `W^{⊗(n−1)}` factor (the grid-size dependence is real,
  ruling out a vacuous stabilization quotient).
- **Euler characteristic:** `χ(GĤ(K)) = Δ_K(t)` on the trefoil and figure-eight,
  and in general (G.4), matching the grid determinant.
- **τ bites:** `τ(T_{3,4}) = 3`; the Milnor conjecture for `T_{2,3}` and `T_{3,4}`
  as instances of G.7; an alternating knot is thin (G.9).
- **Oracle agreement:** spot-check `GĤ` ranks against published tables
  (HFKcalc/Knot Atlas data) for a handful of ≤ 8-crossing knots.
- **Lattice homology:** `ℍ` of a concrete negative-definite plumbing (e.g. the
  `E₈`-plumbing / Poincaré sphere) matches the literature.
- **`HF̂_st` computes:** lens spaces give `𝔽^p` (one generator per spin^c
  structure); `S¹ × S²` exercises weak admissibility.

The reconciliation seam — `HF̂(L(p,q))` computed analytically from the genus-1
diagram agreeing with Lane H's combinatorial computation — is an acceptance
criterion of the [analytic roadmap](../HeegaardFloer/README.md), where the
holomorphic side lives.

## How to drive it

Lanes G.1–3 (with ALG), L, and K can all start immediately and independently. The
spine to push hardest is **G**: it reaches a famous theorem (Milnor conjecture)
entirely within reach of current technology. Lane H follows G once the nice-move
idiom is established. Nothing here waits for the analytic roadmap; the seams between
them are the reconciliation theorems, which the analytic roadmap states and tracks.
